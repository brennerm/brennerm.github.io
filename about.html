    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        Hey folks, you see that guy to the left? That's me.
        A guy that's into sports, cars, motorcycles, bikes and software development.
    </p>
    <p>
        After initially starting as a full time coder I found my passion in properly delivering code and creating a stable and capable infrastructure for it. Call it DevOps, call it SRE, I honestly don't care.

    <br>
    <br>
        At some point in time I wanted to expose myself to a wider variety of projects and became a freelance DevOps and cloud consultant. Currently my main focus is on <a href="/tag/kubernetes">Kubernetes</a>, <a href="/tag/azure">Azure</a> and <a href="/tag/aws">AWS</a>.
    <br>
    <br>
        During my trips I encounter various technologies of the 21st century and run into smaller and bigger mistakes and learn from them. At least that's what I'm telling myself...
    <br>
        This blog is a place, where I write down these experiences and hope to enrich you with valuable information.
        I really don't like to pussyfoot around, that's why I describe my blog style as compact.</p>
