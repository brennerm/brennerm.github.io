        Hey folks, you see that guy to the left? That's me.
        A youngster that's into software development and currently on it's way to decide where to go and what to do.
    </p>

    <p>
        I really like <b>Python and C</b>, sometimes. During my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_education_system">dual studies</a> and my own trips through the technologies of the 21st century, I come across a lot of stuff. 
        This blog is a place, where I write down several impressions and hopefully enrich just some of you guys with valuable information.
        I really don't like to pussyfoot around, that's why I describe my blog style as <b>compact</b>.</p>

    <p>
