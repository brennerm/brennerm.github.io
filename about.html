        Hey folks, you see that guy to the left? That's me.
        A guy that's into sports, cars, motorcycles, bikes and software development.

    <p>
        After initially starting as a full time coder I found more and more pleasure delivering code and making sure that it runs on a stable infrastructure. Call it DevOps, call it SRE, I honestly don't care. As a side hustle I still try to keep me entertained by <a href="https://github.com/brennerm">smaller coding projects</a>. 
    <br>
        During my trips, encountering various technologies of the 21st century, I run into smaller and bigger mistakes and learn from them. At least that's what I'm telling myself... This blog is a place, where I write down these experiences and hope to enrich you with valuable information.
        I really don't like to pussyfoot around, that's why I describe my blog style as <b>compact</b>.</p>
